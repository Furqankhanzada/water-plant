 * Hook: linkUnconnectedPayments (After Change)
 * 
 * Updates payment documents to point to the newly created invoice.
 * The invoice already has the payment IDs (added in calculateAmounts beforeChange hook).
 * 
 * WORKFLOW:
 * 
 * ON CREATE:
 * - Gets payment IDs that were added to the invoice in beforeChange hook
 * - Updates each payment document to set its invoice field to the new invoice ID
 * - This completes the bidirectional relationship between invoice and payments
 * 
 * Note: We DON'T trigger syncPaymentWithInvoice hook because the invoice already
 * has the payments in its array. We're just updating the payment side of the relationship.
