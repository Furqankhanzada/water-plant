 * Hook: injectInvoiceId (Before Change)
 * 
 * Automatically sets the invoice field based on the customer's latest invoice.
 * 
 * WORKFLOW:
 * 
 * ON CREATE:
 * - Takes the customer ID from the payment data
 * - Finds the latest invoice for that customer (isLatest: true)
 * - Sets the invoice field to that invoice ID
 * 
 * ON UPDATE:
 * - If customer changed, finds new customer's latest invoice
 * - If customer stayed same but invoice is missing, finds latest invoice
 * 
 * This hook runs before the document is saved, ensuring the invoice field
 * is always populated correctly before the afterChange hook (syncPaymentWithInvoice) runs.
